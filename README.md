# 30 Days of HackerRank Code Challenge
  This repository contains my solutions to the challenges provided by HackerRank. For each challenge, I have included test cases to ensure that my code works as expected.

# Challenges
Each challenge provided by HackerRank is designed to test my knowledge of various programming concepts, including data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills. For each challenge, I have provided a detailed explanation of the problem and my approach to solving it.

# Test Cases
For each solution, I have included a set of test cases to ensure that my code works as expected. The test cases cover a range of inputs, including edge cases and corner cases. I have also included a description of each test case and the expected output.
